# NADI Task System

VSCode extension for Domain Specific Language (DSL) of the Network Analysis and Data Integration (NADI) System.

The extension provides basic syntax highlight for the DSL and the network files.

To install it, goto the releases, download the `.vsix` file, and use `Install from VSIX` option in the VsCode Extensions tab.

# Future Features
These are the features I'd like to implement, but I do not have a lot of time to work on this, so contributions are welcome:

- [ ] Ability to run the tasks by sending the file to terminal `nadi {file}`,
- [ ] Ability to run tasks line by line interatively in terminal,
- [ ] Ability to open Network View on the side pane (this might be complex, maybe using hooks and saving svgs each task execution), etc.
